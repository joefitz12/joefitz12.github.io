## Built using Extra.css Houdini CSS library

## SASS
sass --watch sass/_style.scss sass/style.css

## Development
JS
- Look into vanilla JS doc ready or alternative dom load triggers

CSS
- Build utilities
   - Box shadow
   - Border-radius
- Standardize class / mix-in structure

Cards
- Need another font that isn't all caps for the card text
- Make cards (after they're all drawn) disappear in a puff of smoke
- Deck of cards "grows" out of DOM (as if screen was containing it) using drop shadow and same color as background

Vines
- Add ability for user to input values for vine radius / leaf size, growth speed

Controller
- Add some kind of display that shows which color has been chosen

Future-future
- Create houdini vine/leaf worklet
